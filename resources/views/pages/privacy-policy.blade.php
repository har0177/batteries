		information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or our
		practices with regards to your personal information.</p>


	<p>When you&nbsp;use our mobile application,&nbsp;as the case may be (the “<strong>App</strong>“)&nbsp;and more
		generally, use any of our services (the “<strong>Services</strong>“, which include the&nbsp;App), we appreciate that
		you are trusting us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we
		seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you
		have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any
		terms in this privacy notice&nbsp;that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our Services immediately.</p>


	<p>This privacy notice applies to all information collected through our Services (which, as described above, includes
		our&nbsp;App), as well as any related services, sales, marketing or events.</p>


	<p><strong>Please read this privacy notice&nbsp;carefully as it will help you understand what we do with the
			information that we collect.</strong></p>

			when you visit our&nbsp;</em><em>App</em><em>.</em></p>

		such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,
		device name, country, location, information about who and when you use our&nbsp;App&nbsp;and other technical
		information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our&nbsp;App, and for our
		internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>


	<p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>The information we collect includes:</p>


	<ul>
		<li><em>Log and Usage Data.</em>&nbsp;Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic usage and performance

			type and settings and information about your activity in the&nbsp;App&nbsp;(such as the date/time stamps associated
			with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you use), device

			us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information
			either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Locations settings on your device. Note however, if
			you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

	<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection

	<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or

		electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
		cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
		defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best
		to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our&nbsp;App&nbsp;is at your

		or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
		monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
		has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
		automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we
